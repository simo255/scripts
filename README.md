'buildrom.sh'

Compile ROM's in 3 easy terminal commands:

$ git clone https://github.com/AzzyC/scripts.git

$ sudo chmod +x scripts/buildrom.sh

$ . scripts/buildrom.sh

One eternity later...

Profit!

Factoring in PC power and internet speed, the script will prompt a User on what Device, ROM and Android Version they would like to compile to make the operation less tedious.

As well as the prompts, there are also thorough guiding comments covering details in the sync & compile stages, under almost all commands, so a User can understand what is happening with context. Futhermore there are a few example commands, which should give the User an idea in how they can alternate what they are compiling. This is due to if a User finds that their desired ROM was not found in the scripts options alone, they can manually add it to the script accordingly to the examples. The script should therefore encourage users to begin experimenting and better learn the ropes on how to compile than traditional methods. It would be recommended for you follow-though reading the script a couple of times to then make suitable edits.

Effectively, the script runs commands which would have otherwise been inputted by manual input which gets tedious and repetitive over time, so this script automates them to keep compiling interesting. This script not only aims to automate but to teach users how they could adapt and compile ROM's with their future devices.

Compiling code should be the easy part, it's major thanks to the developers that give us foundation sources for us to use and take liberty with.

Yours truly,

Some Users can be financially disadvantaged to being able operate the best spec hardware, with a stupid amount of RAM and tasks like video rendering, ROM compiling, etc. can take a substantial toll on a machine. Fortunately, all Users have a chance at a $300 Trial for Google Cloud Platform where they can loan a machine to their desired specs for as long their Free Trial remains, which after of course Users should be entitled to pay. The machine can be accessed only via an SSH Terminal which not every user may be comfortable with and would rather prefer to work in a GUI Environment instead.

This is where this script takes a role. Bashing this script will setup a VNC Server for a Google Cloud machine, whereby it can be connected out with a GUI Ubuntu (Gnome) Desktop that Users can access with an VNC Viewer, such as https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
